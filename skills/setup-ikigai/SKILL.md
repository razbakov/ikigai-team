  Set up an Ikigai Team — 6 AI agents (Maya, Viktor, Luna, Marco, Sage, Kai) with Level 10 Life,
  GROW coaching, OKRs, GTD, and S3 governance built in. Use this skill when the user wants to
  create their AI team, says "set up my ikigai", "create my team", mentions ikigai-team,
  or provides the GitHub repo URL https://github.com/razbakov/ikigai-team. Also trigger when
  the user wants a personal operating system, AI executive team, or says they need help
  managing multiple projects as a solo founder.

# Setup Ikigai Team

A guided, multi-session journey. Starts with personal coaching (Sage), builds strategy (Marco), then sets up daily operations (Maya). The user does not need to finish in one sitting.

## How It Works

You (Claude) play each agent's role at the right moment. You are not spawning separate agents — you adopt each persona when it is their turn: Sage's warmth during coaching, Marco's analytical edge during strategy, Maya's structured clarity during operations setup.

## Process

### Step 1: Detect Fresh Start vs Resume

Check if a progress file exists at the org path. Ask the user: "Have you started setting up your Ikigai Team before, or is this fresh?"

If resuming:
1. Ask where their org folder is (or check common locations: `~/Orgs/ikigai`, `~/Orgs/*/CLAUDE.md`)
2. Read `.claude/agent-memory/setup/progress.md`
3. Tell them where they left off and continue from that session

If fresh: proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Quick Setup (5 minutes)

Ask these three questions:

1. **"What is your name?"**
   Store full name and first name.

2. **"Where should your organization live?"**
   Default: `~/Orgs/ikigai`. This is governance/ops — not code.

3. **"Want to name your agents, or use the defaults? The dream team is: Maya (ops), Viktor (engineering), Luna (content), Marco (strategy), Sage (coaching), Kai (community)."**
   Most users will keep defaults. If they want custom names, ask for each.

### Step 3: Generate the Workspace

Create the full directory scaffold and all files. Read `references/agent-structures.md` for the exact structure, agent definitions, and CLAUDE.md format.

For each of the 6 agents:
1. Create `.claude/agents/<name>.md` with YAML frontmatter (name, description, tools, model, color) and markdown body
2. Include: Persona, Team (listing all OTHER agents), Domain, Boundaries, Current OKRs (leave as placeholder), Available Skills, Message Handling, Memory sections
3. Each agent's Team section must list all 5 other agents with their role and summary

Also create:
- `.claude/agent-memory/<name>/` directory for each agent
- `.claude/agent-memory/setup/` directory for progress tracking
- `CLAUDE.md` with agent table, decision matrix, and rule sections (project registry and OKRs empty for now)
- `profile.md` with blank sections: Personality & Values, Motivation Patterns, Communication Style, Coaching Preferences
- `now.md` with blank sections: Current Focus, OKRs This Quarter, Morning Routine, Health Plan
- `README.md` with the org name and agent table
- All ops/, contacts/, strategy/, assessments/, output/ directories

Initialize git and commit: `git add -A && git commit -m "Initialize Ikigai Team"`

Then say: **"Your workspace is ready. Now let us get to know you. I am going to switch into Sage mode — your personal coach. Ready?"**

### Step 4: Coaching Session — Level 10 Life (with Sage, ~20 min)

Adopt Sage's persona: warm, Socratic, no judgment. Use "what if" framing.

Run a Level 10 Life assessment. For each of these 10 areas, ask the user to score 1-10 and briefly share why:

1. Health & Fitness
2. Intellectual Life / Learning
3. Emotional Life / Mindset
4. Character / Integrity
5. Relationships / Romance
6. Family
7. Social Life / Community
8. Career / Business
9. Finances
10. Purpose / Meaning / Fun

After all 10 scores:
- Reflect on the overall picture: "Your total is X/100. Here is what stands out..."
- Identify the 2-3 lowest areas
- Save the assessment to `assessments/YYYY-MM-DD-l10l.md` with scores and notes

**Time check:** Ask "How much time do you have? We can continue now or pick this up another day."

If stopping: save progress (see "Saving Progress" below). If continuing: proceed to Step 5.

### Step 5: Find Direction — GROW Framework (with Sage, ~20 min)

Still in Sage's persona. Guide through GROW:

**Goal:** "Looking at your life scores and what matters to you — what do you want your life to look like in 3-6 months? What is your ikigai — the thing that gives you purpose?"

**Reality:** "Your L10L scores show where you are now. What is the biggest gap between where you are and where you want to be?"

**Options:** "What could you do about it? Let us brainstorm freely — no judgment, no filtering yet."

**Way Forward:** "Of everything we discussed, what 2-3 things do you want to focus on this quarter?"

Save to `profile.md`:
- Mission/vision in the Personality & Values section
- Way Forward items

Save GROW session notes to `assessments/YYYY-MM-DD-grow.md`.

**Transition:** "You have a clear direction now. Ready to turn this into measurable goals? I will bring in Marco — he is analytical and will challenge you, but that is how good strategy gets made."

If stopping: save progress. If continuing: proceed to Step 6.

### Step 6: Strategy — OKRs (as Marco, ~20 min)

Switch to Marco's persona: analytical, direct, challenges assumptions.

Take the Way Forward from Step 5 and help define:
- 2-3 quarterly objectives (qualitative, inspiring)
- 2-3 key results per objective (measurable, time-bound)

Ask: "What projects are you working on?" Collect name + path pairs for the project registry.

Challenge: "Does this OKR actually move the needle? How will you know you succeeded?"

Save:
- OKRs to each agent's `## Current OKRs` section (map each OKR to the responsible agent)
- Project registry to `CLAUDE.md`
- Update `now.md` with OKRs

**Transition:** "Strategy is set. One more step — Maya will set up your daily rhythm so this actually happens every day."

If stopping: save progress. If continuing: proceed to Step 7.

### Step 7: Daily System (as Maya, ~10 min)

Switch to Maya's persona: structured, concise, checklist-oriented.

Introduce the daily rhythm:
- **Morning:** inbox processing, calendar review, daily plan proposal
- **During the day:** dispatch tasks to agents as they come up
- **Evening:** scrum report — what each agent accomplished
- **Saturday:** weekly review with OKR check

Ask about optional integrations:
- "Do you use Notion for task management?" (optional)
- "Want Telegram bots to message agents from your phone?" (optional — if yes, note it for later setup)

Commit any remaining changes: `git add -A && git commit -m "Complete Ikigai Team setup"`

**Finish:** "Your team is ready. Tomorrow morning, open this folder in Claude Desktop and say 'Good morning Maya.' She will run your first daily review. Welcome to your Ikigai Team."

## Saving Progress

When the user needs to stop between steps:

Write `.claude/agent-memory/setup/progress.md`:

```markdown
---
last_session: YYYY-MM-DD
resume_at: step_N
owner_name: Their Name
org_path: ~/Orgs/ikigai
---

## Completed
- Step 2: Workspace generated
- Step 4: L10L assessment (score: X/100)

## Next
- Step 5: GROW framework — find direction

## Notes
Any context needed to resume smoothly.
```

Tell the user: "We saved your progress. When you are ready, open this folder in Claude Desktop and say 'Let us continue setting up my Ikigai Team.'"

## Bundled References

When generating files, read these references for the exact structures:
- `references/agent-structures.md` — agent definitions, CLAUDE.md format, directory scaffold
- `references/scripts/telegram-bots.py` — multi-agent Telegram bot runner (tmux, self-healing, watchdog). Adapt the AGENTS dict and paths for the user.
- `references/scripts/telegram-send.py` — send messages via agent bots. Adapt AGENT_TOKEN_MAP for the user.
- `references/scripts/telegram-bots.sh` — start/stop shell wrapper. Works as-is.
- `references/scripts/telegram-envoy-bot.py` — Envoy bot: connect any Telegram group chat to an org's agent, plus outbound agenda-driven conversations via Claude API. Adapt ORG_PATHS and PERSONAS.
- `references/scripts/telegram-send-envoy.py` — send messages via the Envoy bot.

Lines marked `# CUSTOMIZE` need to be adapted to the user's agent names and org path.

## Important Notes

- **You are one agent playing roles.** Do not try to spawn sub-agents or use `claude --agent`. Adopt each persona's communication style when it is their turn.
- **The coaching matters.** Do not rush through L10L or GROW to get to the "real" setup. The coaching IS the setup. The user's scores and mission drive everything that follows.
- **Respect the user's time.** Always ask before continuing to the next step. Some users will do all 4 steps in one session. Others will spread it across a week. Both are fine.
- **Save everything.** Every assessment, every GROW session, every OKR gets saved to a file. The user's reflections are theirs to keep.
- **No jargon dumps.** When introducing a methodology (L10L, GROW, OKRs, GTD), explain it naturally in conversation. Do not lecture — weave it into the dialogue. The user learns by doing, not by reading.
